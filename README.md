# profileAssistant
My profile editing application.

FOR SETUP and USE:
- If you have Android Studio available, simply clone this project into the IDE and run the build.
  You can use an emulator or physical device, it should work either way. Just make sure to have an 
  emulator installed or a cable to use with your physical device as Android Studio will demand it.
  
ONE KNOWN ISSUE:
- This is in regards to the profile picture feature. The image can be taken from your device camera
  and used as a profile picture. You can also take many photos with the camera and select from those 
  photos within the app and use that as well. The issue is that the image does not save when leaving
  the main activity or coming back to it, hence having to reselect the image every time. I ran out of 
  time to debug this.
  
IMPORTANT:
- When opening the app for the first time on your device, ALLOW CAMERA PERMISSIONS. The app will prompt
  you at the beginning only once per fresh install. If you do not allow the permissions, you will not
  be able to use the camera functionalty for the profile picture feature.
  
ONE LAST THING:
- As I tested the photo taking functionality, there was a slight bug where after taking the photo it did
  no simply allow you to use the photo right then and there. If that happens, just exit the camera application
  and select the option again from this application. It could just be a minor glitch for first time use.
  
* I really enjoyed working on this application and I hope you enjoy using it
